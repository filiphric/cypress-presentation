# Scaling - when and why?

- growth of the test number
- growth of the test execution time
- growth of the project under test
- growth of the services
- growth of the team

<!--
- let’st talk about what do we mean by scaling, becuase the first thing that comes to mind is the that scaling happens when there are certain number of tests in your test suite, but there’s more to that, couple of examples

- each of these poses a different problem
- some of these require to decide early in the project, some are OK to decide later

- generally there’s a very simple threshold that gives you a clear signal that your project is on the scale up trajectory - it is no longer possible to maintain it with one or two people
- so sometimes this is when a project has 100 tests, sometimes it’s when it has 500 tests and sometimes it’s when you just have 30 tests, but they are on three different project
