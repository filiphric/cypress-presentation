- test code and app code should be linked together
- readability and maintainability is the #1 contributing factor to project being slow
- testing should improve speed of delivery
- testing should mitigate risk
- human time is more valuable than machine time

<!--
- let’s start with some principles that guide decisions on these recommendations
- putting them out there, because there are many questions to which "it depends" is the best answer
- we’ll try to approach this webinars with these principles in mind, and if your situation requires a different sets of principles, that’s okay, you can take the advice here with a grain of salt

- test code and app code should be linked together - especially for Cypress - a testing tool
- Cypress does not do well if the code is too detached, if you want to perform so called black-box testing, that’s not what Cypress is good at
- speaking of things Cypress is good at - readability
- bad readability = project being slow, because of maintenance

- something that testers don’t like to hear (I don’t like to hear that as well), is that in most situations, testing is a liability
- maintenance cost, worker cost, tooling,... all that cost your company money
- many companies make the mistake of looking at testing as liability and cut budgets, lay off people
- the thing is - and we all understand it as testers, that there is a value in testing and that without it, things will get worse
- but let’s be honest, we can also make things worse - if testing takes too much time. requires too many people, costs too much (and I mean this relative to the size of the company, size of the project etc.)
